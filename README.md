# FuelPriceShare
FuelPriceShare Android app mobile end code

This android app enables users to

1) Find fuel stations and fuel prices close to any location;

2) Obtain route to a chosen location, and find fuel stations close to the path. Users can also choose to detour via any found station and get the updated path.

The app also records the credit points of each user. Whenever users issue a query, they lose one point. Whenever they contribute updated prices for any fuel station, they gain ten points. In this way, we try to encourage users to contribute the latest fuel prices, and hence use crowdsourcing methods to make everyone happy.

The app has many other functions, such as a) recording usersâ€™ search history and dynamically updating them when users issue the next query, b) setting preferred fuel and default search radius, c) taking/uploading profile photos, etc.

We also deploy many error handling methods to make sure that the app runs robustly.

Main contributors to this app are:

Yu Sun, Han Li, Nurlan Kenzhebekov, He Zhao, Andy Yuan Xue, Yuan Li, and Rui Zhang.
